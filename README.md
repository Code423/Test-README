for a program that stores daily task data and generates a monthly report about its activities,<br>using the Python language.

> **✨ Update:**
> - **Task-Tracker (Completed & Active):** Successfully built and deployed a Python program that logs daily task data and generates automated monthly activity reports.
> - **Data Automation:** Continuously refining the data pipeline for my `Task-Tracker` repo to ensure seamless daily updates.
> - **Problem Solving:** Applying Python logic to optimize my personal workflow and reporting systems.

> - **[Task-Tracker](https://github.com/Anas-Sasa/Task-Tracker)** - A tool that transforms daily logs into structured monthly insights.


### 🌱 I’m currently learning: 

> - Python, Git and Github

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: 

> - Open-source projects that simulate real-world labor market scenarios.
> - Collaborative projects to develop communication skills.

### 🗣 Languages:
